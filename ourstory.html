            <h5><b>About Me</b></h5>
            <p>
              Hi, my name is Lara and Iâ€™m the person behind Baby. Body. Beautiful. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been teaching fitness and supporting peoples fitness journey for over 10 years. I have always had an interest in training pre and postnatal clients but after having my daughter Luna in 2019, I took the leap and did my training course. I felt after experiencing pregnancy and postnatal recovery I was better equipped to help my clients, as I have been through the same things they will be feeling. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I trained throughout my pregnancy. Throughout the early morning sickness nausea when no one but our close family knew, right through to 36 weeks when I stopped incase I went into labour mid class! I honestly feel keeping my fitness levels up helped me lead a happy and healthy pregnancy along with helping my postnatal recovery after an emergency Caesarean section.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am fully qualified to create fitness programmes for both prenatal clients from first trimester to third and postnatal clients juggling new motherhood. I can also give nutritional advice alongside the sessions to help you lead a fit and healthy pre and postnatal journey. You can be rest assured that the sessions are held with the latest medical guidance and are safe for each trimester. Options during sessions will change depending on what trimester you are in, be it first or fourth!
            </p>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          I came up with the name Baby. Body. Beautiful. as I reflects my views on bodies during and after this amazing
          experience. The stretch marks and scars are a trophy for the wonderful journey that your body has been
          through.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often social media and tabloids tell us our bodies should be a certain way during pregnancy and that we should
          bounce back straight after having a baby. This often isnâ€™t true! Iâ€™ve felt the pressure to look a certain way
          and felt anxious about my body after pregnancy and I donâ€™t want anyone else to be made to feel this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyoneâ€™s pre and postnatal story is different and focusing on your physical health and mental well-being is
          much more important. Juggling morning sickness and Braxton hicks or sleep deprivation and getting to grips
          with a newborn is hard enough without the extra pressure of being made to fit into a certain mould.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, if you are looking for a motivational, non judgemental and supportive place for your motherhood journey then look no further, we are here to look after you ðŸ©µ
