                    This class is designed for mums to help improve their fitness levels, challenge their bodies and
                    help with mental well-being.
                </p>

                    There will be options throughout for no matter what stage of your postnatal journey you are at,
                    whether just coming back into fitness or have been exercising with me for a while ðŸ’—
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pre crawlers are welcome to attend on a mat or blanket beside you or you can bring your little one
                    in a pram/buggy if they prefer. I also bring a large mat with me for you to pop little ones in in
                    the
                    middle to connect with each other. Children under 5 are welcomed to attend with you in these
                    sessions. And you
                    are always welcome to feed, change, comfort your baby during any part of the class.

                <h4>Fridays @ 9.30am</h4><br>
                <h4>Old School Rooms, Rothley</h4>
                <p>
                    This class is my DANCE&TONE class but in the daytime for my mum squad to enjoy ðŸ©µ There will be disco lights to provide that sensory stimulation for the babies and allow you to get your dance on a Friday. Shake, shimmy, strut and twerk your way to fitness in this fun 30 minute workout. I do however recommend doing my strong mummy movement course before attending this class to ensure you have done some core and pelvic floor work and ensure you are safe for a higher intensity workout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Included in this session is our mama circle at 10:15 before your class starts at 10:45. This means you can have a cuppa and connect with other mums before your session and little ones can connect too. A reusable cup is recommended however we do have spares in the kitchen if you forget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Little ones must be kept in their pram/buggy for safety during this class. As there is more movement due to dance moves than my normal classes this is very important. However there will be space with chairs should you need to comfort baby. You are always welcome to feed, change, comfort your baby during any part of the class, we completely get it here at Baby. Body. Beautiful.
