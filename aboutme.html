        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Lara and Iâ€™m the mama behind Baby. Body. Beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been teaching fitness and supporting peoples fitness journey for over 13 years. I have always had an
          interest in training pre and postnatal clients but after having my daughter Luna in 2019, I took the leap and
          did my training course. I felt after experiencing pregnancy and postnatal recovery I was better equipped to
          help my clients, as I have been through the same things they will be feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I trained throughout my pregnancy. Throughout the early morning sickness nausea when no one but our close
          family knew, right through to 36 weeks when I stopped incase I went into labour mid class! I honestly feel
          keeping my fitness levels up helped me lead a happy and healthy pregnancy along with helping my postnatal
          recovery after an emergency Caesarean section.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am fully qualified to create fitness programmes for both prenatal clients from first trimester to third and
          postnatal clients juggling new motherhood. I can also give nutritional advice alongside the sessions to help
          you lead a fit and healthy pre and postnatal journey. You can be rest assured that the sessions are held with
          the latest medical guidance and are safe for each trimester. Options during sessions will change depending on
          what trimester you are in, be it first or fourth!
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed my Doula training in 2022 with the Every Birth Matters course. It is something I have wanted to do
          for a while, but waiting for the right course at the right time was important to me so when this one came
          along I took the leap and started my training. This included pre coursework, live and online training, post
          coursework all of which I have passed and am now certified. I am now completing extra training in a mentorship
          with my course tutor Katy. This means I can gain extra knowledge after the course to further help in your
          birth, labour and postnatal journey. It also means you get 2 doulas for the price of one as I always have back
          up on the phone should something unexpected arise, as well as getting a discounted price whilst I complete
          this extra training. Upon completing my training I also participated in an extra hypnobirthing skills workshop
          to help assist mums to be and their partners further.
